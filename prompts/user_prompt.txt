The action takes place in a fantasy world, there are dark elves, forest elves, dragons of different elements and many other races that exist in the D&D board game. There are 4 main characters for which players play: the anthropomorphic cat Sarkis, the anthropomorphic hedgehog Terryl Thorny, the circus fairy and the vampire Liarin. Use this to write a script as the basic structure of the world.
